In the open source community, we've all been asking ourselves for awhile how
we can make open source more sustainable. There's a lot of very different ideas
about it, but the one thing that everyone agrees on is that more people need to
start getting paid for their open source work.

At Atlassian, we've been wondering how to build better developer tools for our
teams. We decided that open source was a huge part of that. We need to work
closely with the community to make sure that we're building tools that are
going to continue working for us years into the future.

My name is Jamie. I'm an open source developer at Atlassian, I primarily work
on tools for front-end developers like Babel, Yarn, Flow, Lerna, Marionette,
and many more. I've been working primarily in open source for the last 4 years.
It's incredibly rewarding, but it's also extremely stressful and it's really
hard to stay motivated in a sustainable way.

I've been saying for awhile that open source would be fine if we just had a
team of people focused on open source full-time. Open source tends to be
powered by people who need to put on many different hats. You're the CEO, the
janitor, the politician, and sometimes the movie star. It's too much, and it
prevents so many people from getting more into the open source ecosystem.

We need teammates, managers, and all the rest. We need a team of people who
work together to make plans, delegate responsibilities, and review eachother's
work. We need an organization that can move around resources as necessary and
fund important work.

**okay.build** is my team's attempt at doing that.

## Public Source vs. Open Source

We were born out of an org at Atlassian called "Product Fabric" which focuses
on building components and services which can be used together to build all of
Atlassian's products. Almost all of the code written in Product Fabric is open
source. You can see the [source code on Bitbucket][atlaskit].

But a lot of this boils down to what we've started to call "public source".
It's _technically_ open source because of its licensing and publicly accesible
source code. But it doesn't really resemble all the values of the open source
community.

All of the planning and development happens internally. Non-Atlassian's would
have a tough time figuring out what we are doing at any given time, and they
don't have nearly as much opportunity to get involved as they should.

Lots of companies find themselves in this situation. They go through the
process of open sourcing a piece of code, but without really engaging with the
open source community, they never get any of the benefits back. It's lead to
companies really underestimating the impact open source can have.

## Building the Build

Late last year we set out to create a new front-end build systems team at
Atlassian to speed up front-end teams and enable them to build better user
experiences by removing techincal limitations.

We focus on everything from package managers, to compilers, to testing
frameworks, documentation, examples, and a whole lot more. When we started
planning out how we'll make all these things work well together, we knew we'd
have to be integrated with the rest of the open source community or we'd end
up forking the entire ecosystem internally.

Through open source, everyone has the opportunity to set the standards for our
shared toolchain. That's the kind of impact that we want to have, and to do it
we need to embed ourselves in the open source community.

## Opening up

To become a fully open team, we decided we needed to make everything we could
public. We need to default to making things open instead of closed.

So here's what we have so far:

- All of our planning will be on a [public Trello board](/plans).
- All of our documentation will be up [on a public website](/docs).
- All of our processes will be [documented publicly](/docs).
- All of our reports will be up on a [public blog](/blog).
- We can invite anyone to join pur planning meetings as often as needed.
- We will develop code in [public repos from day one](/projects).

As we went through everything that we do, there was very little that we saw
which couldn't just be public. There was no value in keeping things behind
closed doors, and by defaulting to making everything public means that we are
open without any additional effort.

## okay.build

We were making so many things public, that it started to feel a lot like the
core team of an open source project than a team at a company. And we realized
that we could benefit a lot from structuring our team so that "external"
collaborators could join and feel like an equal part of our team.

So we're trying to structure ourselves so that people that want a part in
building out next generation developer tools can do so with us, either as an
individual or as part of another company.

We've named our team **okay.build** because we wanted something that anyone
could feel a part of. So that it doesn't become "That Atlassian Team".

## Thanks

I really want to thank Atlassian for getting this started. I really can't
believe how supportive everyone has been of every idea we've had. Even when
they've been really _out there_. I'm really really excited by the work that
we're going to be able to do.

I also want to thank [Orta Therox](https://twitter.com/orta) for helping shape
our thinking about this. His team at Artsy has been doing "open source by
default" for awhile and their experience had a big impact on the work that we
are doing.
