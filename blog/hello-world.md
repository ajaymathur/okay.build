We've all been asking ourselves for awhile about how we make open source
sustainable. There's a lot of very different ideas about it, but the one thing
that everyone agrees on is that people need to start getting paid.

My name is Jamie. I'm an open source developer and you may know some of my work,
whether it be on Babel, Yarn, Flow, Lerna, Marionette, or [others](https://jamie.build/#code).
Open source has been incredibly rewarding to me, but it's a massive burden and
it's really hard to stay motivated.

I've been saying for awhile that open source would be fine if I just had a team
of people around me all focused on it. If I had other developers who I could
plan and make decisions with, if I had a manager delegating work, if I had a
organization which could move resources around when needed and fund important
work.

**okay.build** is my team's attempt at doing that.

Recently I joined [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) after contracting with
them for the last 8 months. In that time, every line of code that I have
written was open source. The org that I've been working in "Product Fabric"
already did that by default.

But a lot of this boiled down to what I call "public source". It's technically
open source because of the licensing and the fact that the code is publicly
accessible, but it doesn't really resemble the open source community in any
other way.

All of our planning, all of our development, it all happened internally behind
walls others couldn't see through. Externally you would have very little idea
about what we're doing at any time. Only the results of our work are public.

We set out to create a new front-end build systems team at Atlassian late last
year to speed up front-end teams and enable them to build better user
experiences.

When we looked at the tooling we'd be working with and on, from package
managers to compilers to testing frameworks and a whole lot more, it only made
sense that everything we'd work on would be open source.

Even further, it made sense that we really embed ourselves in the open source
ecosystem. We weren't going to fork everything and create our own platform, that
would be a complete failure. Instead, we can work with the existing community
and improve it as a whole.

So we needed to become a truly **open** team. And the more we talked to people
about it, the further we wanted to take it. We went from just wanting our code
to be public to wanting our planning, our communication, our quarterly reports,
our onboarding processes, our documentation, and everything else we can think
of all to be public.

We were making so many things public that it got to the point where we were
questioning, is this even an "Atlassian" team? We look a lot more like a
framework core team or some sort of foundation.

So instead of being an open team at Atlassian, what if we were an open team
that any one can join as part of their company or even as an individual? The
members of the team can continue being paid by their companies, just as
Atlassian will be paying their employees (including myself) to be part of this
team.

That's why you don't see company branding on this site. That's why some of
the projects are in other GitHub orgs. That's why we can create projects
whenever we want without a company's legal team's approval. That's why our
projects can be MIT licensed. That's why we allow ourselves to be influenced by
others and change direction as we see fit.

We still need to accomplish things at our companies. But considering how
impactful open source is on the way that people work, it's very easy to do.

If you want to join our team, just come talk to one of us about it. There's no
barrier to entry other than willingness to contribute something positive. And
if you want to get paid for your contributions, come talk to our team members
about Atlassian or somewhere else and we might hire you to do this full time.

This might start to sound a bit like a foundation. But it's much more open than
most foundations. We're a group of people supporting and contributing to open
source projects without trying to assert any kind of ownership.

I want to thank Atlassian for getting this started. I really can't believe how
supportive they've been of every idea we've had here. I'm really excited to be
joining a company which is this empowering.

I also want to thank [Orta Therox](https://twitter.com/orta) for helping shape
our thinking about this. His team at Artsy has been doing "open source by
default" for awhile and their experience had a big impact on the work that we
are doing.
